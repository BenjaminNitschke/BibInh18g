Roman Numerals Algorithm
========================

Input Number = 42
Result = ""
Loop until Number reaches 0
	Go through all possible Symbols from Highest to Lowest (M, D, C, L, X, V, I)
		If number is >= Symbol, add Symbol to Result, reduce Number
End Loop
Output Result

Improve by adding CM=900, CD=400, XC=90, XL=40, IX=9, IV=4 to get all the 9 and 4-cases correct!
